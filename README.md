# Front-end Web Dev Quizzer

## Application Description
The "Quizzer" is a short timed quiz tool that tests the user's knowledge of various front-end resources including JavaScript.

Users are presented with five multiple choice questions and must choose the correct answer for each by clicking it.  Correct answers are acknowleged on screen and add points to the final score. Incorrect answers are also acknowleged, but will not add to the score. An incorrect answer will be penalized and 10 seconds will be subtracted from the remaining time on the clock, which is always visble as it decrements.  Users will have a maximum of 60 seconds to complete all five questions.

Once the quiz ends, the score will be shown. The user will then enter their initials and click "save" to register their score. Users may then click the "restart" button to try again for a better score.  Users may retry as many times as they like.
